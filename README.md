Frontend Engineer on a quest to become a truly exceptional programmer. Working hard, staying consistent and continuing to learn.

The technology stack I continue to practice includes React, Redux, TypeScript, Webpack, Styled Components, Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress and Playwright.

Many other technologies are used, but these are used daily.
